# Delivery_route_opimisation

The problem at hand was  to develop an optimization methodology that can identify the best combination of packages to be grouped together for shipping and transporting.
This methodology should incorporate and expand the route optimization techniques that are currently used by the company.
The goal is to minimize shipping costs while ensuring timely and efficient delivery of packages to their destinations. 
The solution should will take  into account factors such as package and truck volume, size, destination, delivery time and any special shipping requirements. 
The proposed methodology should be scalable and adaptable to changes in package volumes and delivery routes.
